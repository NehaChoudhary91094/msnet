General description

Write a program to analyze three dataset given in input.
Three dataset provided includes city-pin-states dataset, customers dataset and orders dataset. Each dataset will have one or more number of rows. These datasets are separated by empty line (in console input).

1. city-pin-states dataset
  * Each row contains pin code, city and state separated by comma.
  * It is given as argument to the intended function as argument List<city> pinStatesList.

2. customers dataset
  * Each row contains customer id, name and pin code.
  * It is given as argument to the intended function as argument List<customer> custList.

3. orders dataset
  * Each row contains order id, customer id and amount.
  * It is given as argument to the intended function as argument List<order> orderList.

Note that in these datasets order id, customer id, amount and pin code are integers; while all other fields are strings. Code for reading datasets from console is already implemented in class Program. Also code for printing output is also implemented there. You may refer that code but must not modify the same. You are expected to implement your code into class Solution as per problem statement given below.

Problem 1: Find state with single city in the dataset.
  * Implement your code into statesHavingSingleCity(pinStatesList) function.
  * You are expected to return name of states for whom only one (unique) city is given in the data.
  * As given in base code, return type must be String.
  * If each state have multiple cities in dataset, return empty string.

Problem 2: Find name of customer having maximum total order amount.
  * Implement your code into customerOfMaxOrderTotal(custList, orderList) function.
  * From orders dataset find the customer id having maximum total order amount. Then from customers dataset find the name of customer corresponding to that id and return it.
  * As given in base code, return type must be String.
  * If multiple customers have same maximum total, return name of customer having lowest customer id.
  * If no such customer is found, return string "None".

Refer the sample input explaination below for the better clarity of the problem statement.

.Net Collections Quick Reference:
 

Problem 1 Explanation:
  * In sample input, four city, pin and states data is provided.
  * Here Maharashtra state have two states i.e. Mumbai and Pune.
  * Bihar and Tamilnadu have single city (i.e. Patna and Chennai respectively). So function is expected to return String contains "Bihar", "Tamilnadu".

Problem 2 Explanation:
  * In sample input, two customers mayur (customer id=1) and nitin (customer id=2) are provided.
  * As per input total order amount for mayur (customer id=1) is 600 (100 + 200 + 300) and total order amount for nitin (customer id=2) is 300 (150 + 150). 
  * Since customer id 1 have higher total amount, return his name i.e. "mayur" from the function.
